Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

DriverPass is a company tailored towards helping students pass their driver’s test. The focus in the system design was for an online website to host training material and practice tests. The Clients wanted the material to be viewed via mobile or desktop. I presented a solution to build a website using the power of the cloud to help minimize expense. Not only did the system achieve the goals of DriverPass, I kept in mind how to help their company become profitable. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have liked to dive more into the system designs for the UML diagrams. The goal is to expand all the diagrams to the full working state of the website.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The owners of DriverPass help shine light on what was a hard requirement and what features they would like. They talked about how they wanted their students to learn from anywhere, ensure security was at the front and Admin’s had the power to oversee changes to user’s accounts.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

While designing software I like to start at the lowest level and work my way. For example, when breaking down the package purchase workflow, I started with listing all parties involved. The user, frontend, backend, and the credit car company. Then I wrote down the process the user would have to do to purchase a training package. From there I started to organize my thought process and making the system design.
